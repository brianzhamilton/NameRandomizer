#### **Summary:**        

This program is a Random Name Selector hosted on Github Pages. Users are able to enter names into a textbox and, clicking "add name," adding them to a list. From this list, the users are able to randomly select any number of winners, from one to the maximum number of names on the list. Users have the option of removing a winner from the list upon selection, to exempt previous winners from future selection.

Additionally, users are able to remove select names from the list, or they may click "reset" and start their list over entirely from scratch.
